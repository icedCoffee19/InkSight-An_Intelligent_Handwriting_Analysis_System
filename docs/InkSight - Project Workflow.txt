InkSight - Project Workflow (Update 3)

Comprehensive workflow and design plan with tech stack suggestions, data sources, and model 
architecture decisions that align with your objectives.
 
? 1. Finalized Project Workflow for InkSight
A. User Interface (Frontend Web App)
*	Upload handwriting image
*	Choose task:
o	Handwriting Recognition (HCR)
o	Personality Profiling via Graphology
o	Both
*	Show dashboard: recognized text + personality profile charts/graphs
 
B. Backend (AI + Processing Engine)
*	Preprocessing: noise removal, skew correction, binarization
*	Module 1 - HCR Pipeline:
o	CNN or CNN-RNN model for character/word recognition
o	Return transcribed text
*	Module 2 - Graphology Engine:
o	Feature extraction from handwriting (slant, pressure, spacing, loops)
o	Predict psychological traits (MBTI/Big Five/stress/cognitive health)
o	Display trait confidence scores with visualization
*	Result Storage:
o	MongoDB/Firestore for storing user input, output, and feedback
 
C. Output Visualization Dashboard
*	BI visualizations (using libraries like Chart.js, D3.js, or Plotly)
*	Graphs: slant chart, pressure heatmap, personality radar/spider graph
*	Text outputs + downloadable results
 
? 2. Finalized Technology Stack
Component
Recommended Tools (Beginner Friendly)
Frontend
HTML/CSS + JavaScript + React.js (for interactivity)
UI Components
Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap + ShadCN (for fast UI building)
Backend API
FastAPI (Python) - beginner-friendly, fast
Model Serving
TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch + ONNX for exporting models
Database
MongoDB (document-based, good for flexible JSON-style storage)
Image Uploads
Firebase Storage or Cloudinary
Deployment
Vercel (Frontend) + Render or Railway (for Python backend)
Dashboard Tools
Plotly.js, Chart.js, or Streamlit (if dashboard is backend-generated)
BI/Analytics
Optional: Integrate with Power BI/Google Data Studio using APIs or connectors
 
? 3. Recommended Datasets
Module
Dataset
HCR
IAM Dataset, CVL, EMNIST (you already have these)
Graphology
IAM + Custom annotated dataset (MBTI traits, stress levels, etc.)
Multilingual Expansion (future)
KHATT (Arabic), Devanagari, Bangla handwriting sets
 
? 4. Suggested Models for Processing Modules
?? HCR Module
Stage
Model/Method
Preprocessing
OpenCV (binarization, denoising, skew correction)
Feature Extraction
CNN (e.g., ResNet, VGG) on character/word images
Sequence Learning
CNN + BiLSTM + CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification) for full lines
Output
Transcribed text in English (extendable to other languages)
?? Use pretrained models on IAM or EMNIST initially, then fine-tune.
 


?? Graphology Module
Stage
Method
Structural Features
Slant, loops, pressure, baseline, spacing - from image using OpenCV
Feature Classifier
Use Random Forest / SVM / Gradient Boosting initially
Deep Learning
CNN on whole image (e.g., personality classification)
Hybrid Model
Combine handcrafted features + CNN embedding for best results
Output
MBTI/Big Five traits + stress + mood + cognitive markers
?? Inspired by papers like Gagiu et al. (2025), Kim et al. (2022)
 
? 5. Privacy & Ethics Layer
Concern
Solution
Identity Protection
Separate user identity from data using hash or UUID
Data Minimization
Store only essential features and anonymized text
Explainability & Transparency
Show "Why" behind predictions (rules or saliency maps)
Consent & Opt-out
Provide checkbox for data usage/feedback during upload
 
? 6. Project Timeline Suggestion (Modular Milestones)
Phase
Duration
Goal
Phase 1
Week 1-2
